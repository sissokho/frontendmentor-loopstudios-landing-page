# Frontend Mentor - Loopstudios landing page

This is my solution to the [Loopstudios landing page challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/loopstudios-landing-page-N88J5Onjw) on Frontend Mentor.

It is built with Tailwind CSS.

[Live preview](https://sissokho.github.io/frontendmentor-loopstudios-landing-page/).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the project.
git clone https://github.com/sissokho/frontendmentor-loopstudios-landing-page.git

# Install the dependencies.
npm install

# Run the development server. Vite is the default build tool.
npm run dev
```

Then, open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

## Code formatting

To format the code with prettier, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm run format
```

However, this process is automated and done before each commit thanks to [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged).
